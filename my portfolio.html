                    <h3>Master of Engineering</h3>

                    <p>
                        My quest to acquire a master of engineering qualification was aroused by the fact that my father had told me when I was little that education is the key and that no knowledge is a waste. After three years of graduation from the Nnamdi Azikiwe University,
                        Awka, I got admission into Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State, Nigeria to study advanced engineering in the department of Chemical Engineering. Although I have completed my course work and am supposed to have
                        graduated but there was a delay by the University orchestrated by the strike by ASUU which after few months of this strike came-forth the COVID-19 pandemic.
